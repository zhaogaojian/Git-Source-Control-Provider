Visual Studio Data Tools 2017/2015 Support            {#ssdt}
========

* Visual Visual Studio Data Tools 2015 needs to be at Update 3 or Later.
* Note: As of 5/23/18 - In SSDT 2017: Solution Explorer Status Icons and the Status bar may not work.  All other features work, including the right click menu in the solution explorer and the pending changes window. There does not appear to be anything can be done to fix this, because the built in SCC providers also don't work.

How to contribute 
----------
If you like this plugin there is a few way you can help out.

* Review It! - I'm not asking for donations or anything, but if you do use this and like it.. Please head over to the [Visual Studio Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/51e11ccc-6334-4873-912d-bf5025eb115d) and review it.  Good reviews refill my nerd powers that power all those late night programming sessions. They also make me feel all warm and fuzzy! 
* Suggest Features / Point out bugs. 
* Test It - Check out the [Releases](https://github.com/jzoss/Git-Source-Control-Provider/releases). If there is a early release try it out and let me know if you find any bugs!
* Code - Check out the code, play with it. maybe fix a bug while you are there.. It fun and educational. It also makes you super cool, better looking and possibly give you superpowers.

#### Help Wanted - Features/Fixes 
* Options Page - Settings are stored in a user folder, this is not how it is supposed to work. The UI the UI is ugly does not look right on high dpi monitors. See [Example](https://github.com/Microsoft/VSSDK-Extensibility-Samples/tree/master/Options_Page)
* Localization - I would be nice to support a few other  languages.
* Button commands - This part is a bit messy right now. It would be sweet if this could be cleaned up.

#### Building

All you need to build the code is Visual Studio 2015 with Visual Studio Extensibility Tools installed. It's **THAT** easy!
